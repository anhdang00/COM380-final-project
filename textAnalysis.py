g1 =	"God Father	Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
g2	= "God Father	This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
g3 =	"God Father	Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10. But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl. To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium. But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score. Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character). Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame. If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film."
g4	= "God Father	This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day.. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. This is definetely a \"must see\" masterpiece."
g5 =	"God Father	The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
g6	=	"The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made."
g7	= "God Father	This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic. To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same. Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility. 2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street). 3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible. All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on. I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
g8	= "God Father	The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that. The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination. But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years. The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two. However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing. To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible. There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable. The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous. The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
g9	= "God Father	Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money"
g10	= "God Father	I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as \"The Greatest Movie of All Time\". I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind. And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on. But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time. Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film). But The Godfather? It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence. Give me a break. The fact that this movie is so \"beloved\" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."
g11	= "God Father	This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10"
g12	=	"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
g13	=	"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it. I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more. The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\" It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better."
g14	=	"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot. Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role. John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history. Do not miss this film!"
g15	=	"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, \"Oh that was 10 out of 10.\" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes. A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are. I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together. I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them. Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
g16	=	"I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as \"#1\" on the IMDb. It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas (1950s and 1960s) was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s. So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition. There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the \"offer you can't refuse\" line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make. For those who say \"oh, you just didn't get it, see it again\", please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like. The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review."
g17	=	"I remember distinctly the first time I saw \"The Godfather\". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television. Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film. I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it. The second time I saw the film was in college. My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted \"The Godfather\" as the finest film. One evening my friend and I watched the film. The viewing once again left me unimpressed. I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation. Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a \"good movie\" when I saw one. Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare. I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed \"The Godfather\" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants. Well, I think you know the outcome. As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out. I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way. I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow. There is no moral center. I do not demand that a movie have morality. I do not demand that a film even have a point. I can take a film at its face value for what it is. A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire. The problem is that \"The Godfather\" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations. Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza. However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst. We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it. Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself. Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men. But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous. To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider. I find it interesting that many of those who claim \"The Godfather\" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the \"fans\" I know. A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD \"Godfather\" collection that he received for Christmas. As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it? That is faint praise indeed for the \"greatest film of all time\". I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie. I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. \"The Godfather\" is a paper tiger."
g18	=	"I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end? If so, you've seen 90 percent of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not \"best movie ever material.\""
g19	=	"Does \"Godfather\" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name \"Corleone\" which translates as \"Lionhearted,\" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? Godfather is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. \"Godfather\" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor. Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called \"bait and switch.\" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of \"Godfather\" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented. So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name \"Lionheart.\""
g20	=	"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me. This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions. But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line. The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers. Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys. This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum. Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."

g21 = "This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named \"The Best Movie of All Time.\"	"

g22="One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred \"Goodfellas\". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to."

g23 = "Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either."

g24="This movie continues to be praised, but when I rented it I only made it through 45 minutes before I stopped the video. There aren't many movies that are so bad I don't watch the whole thing, but \"The Godfather\" is that bad. I don't care how much other people may like it. I still say it sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks,sucks..."

g25 = "I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters. It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of. Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie. I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated."

h1 =	"Hunger Game	I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves. When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete. And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated. Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be. What a waste of my time."

h2 =	"Hunger Game	Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF. The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games. It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake. People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching."

h3	=	"As someone who has read the book, seeing it come to life on screen was incredible. It's always interesting to see how certain things from the book were adapted on screen, adding a new experience to the story I've read. The production value, scene locations, and overall ambiance were simply amazing, capturing the essence and aesthetics of the book properly. The music, especially \"The Hanging Tree\", that Katniss sang in the original trilogy, was a highlight, linking this prequel to the original trilogy nicely. Also, the song that Olivia Rodrigo did for this movie \"Can't Catch Me Now\" fit the film's mood and themes well."

h4 =	"Hunger Game	I like the other hunger games movies, with their high and lows they were enjoyable. They were a good transposition of the books. With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end. Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable. If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical. The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies."

h5	= "Hunger Game	This movie was so disappointing, there was just something missing across the board. Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither. What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional. Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more. Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here.

h6	=	"As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing. There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing. The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling. So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done..."

h7 =	"Hunger Game	This movie isn't really \"bad\" as much as ot is bland and souless. I don't exactly what to blame here. The characters have similar dialogues to the ones found in the books. The actors do good acting. The scenes have the right pacing. Yet, the movie is boring and you end up not caring about anything that happened. I guess reading the story from the point of view of cunning Snow helps us understand better his feeling and motivations, here we don't have that and the actor have next to no chemistry! Their actions don't seem like a natural progression of their love and feel more like \"this happens next cause the book said so\". I was really looking forward to watching it. This movie was such a let down for me."

h8 = "Hunger Game	I saw this movie on opening night. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid. This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)"

h9 = "Hunger Game	No of course Katniss isn't in it. The singing is integral to the story, how can you complain about it? It seems many criticisms people are writing about this movie are simply due to individuals not understanding/processing the plot of the film and making judgments based on a lack of comprehension. This movie is a worthy addition to the Hunger Games franchise, satisfying the one question I had coming into it: Why is Snow such a psychopath? Additionally, we get to see another (old fashioned) Hunger Games which we've been waiting for, for nearly a decade! Having not read the book before seeing this film, it really enlightened me to information surrounding the society of Panem that I was previously unaware of / ignorant to. Not a perfect film, but a very good one nonetheless. 8.5/10 at least! I pray there's more to come from Suzanne Collins' mind."

h10	= "Hunger Game	I had very high hopes for this film. The book was great, but the movie was horrible. Only Tom Blyth does a good job acting in this film, the rest of the cast... not so much. Rachel Ziegler just isn't a great actress, granted she is a very talented singer and has a great voice, which is put on display in this movie. However, she just isn't a great actress. The film has the worst cast I have ever seen for a spin off of such a successful original series. I put blame on the casting director for that. The movie also came in a bit longer than most of the other movies and kind of felt a little dragged out. Overall, I'm very disappointed."

h11	=	"I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway."

h12	=	"It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into. I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with. A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal. Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep."

h13	= "Hunger Game	Wow!!! I have been looking forward to this since the book came out, hoping it would be turned into a movie! They truly knew what to keep in the movie, what to adapt and what to leave in the book. Absolutely fantastic! I'm so happy and I loved every second of it. The actors did an amazing portrayal of the characters and the movie had great pacing and flow. As soon as it finished I would have happily stayed in my seat for a second viewing. You could watch this as a standalone but you do get more out of it if you have seen the other movies. You can see all the ground work and you get insight into many characters as well as the creation of the system and how it grew to be what we see in The Hunger Games."

h14	=	"Loved the first 4 movies, so I was very curious about this one. Honestly, I haven't seen anything this bad in a long time. The whole thing felt like a mess, was boring. Didn't even understand the singing scenes. The worst part was Rachel's acting. I don't think she was ready for this movie. She didn't do a great job in my opinion, at all. The only thing I was thinking about the hole time is her bad acting skills. She was way too much in this. I'm just disappointed. Could've been much much better movie. It's always a big risk to recreate a big hit or even follow the storyline, but man oh man....."

h15	=	"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth. Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition. The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader. He partakes as a \"mentor\" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war. The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor. The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV. She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen. In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality. The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels."

h16	=	"Once you notice how they feel the need to say « Lucy Gray » all the time, you won't be able to unhear it, it's painful. Lucy Gray this, Lucy Gray that... Viola Davis is excellent, atmosphere and setting are ok, but all in all it feels like you're watching 3 different movies in one, scenario is - again - the main issue. Main actor lacks charisma and just isn't good enough to be a lead. The singing is really annoying, I don't care if it's like that in the book, they could have integrated it in a much better way. The guitar thing at the tribute presentation... is it X-Factor? And I really wanted to like this movie..."

h17	=	"If there's one popular franchise that I can't seem to like, it's the Hunger Games franchise. None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable."

h18	= "Hunger Game	Initially I didn't like the ending. I didn't like how they just made her 'disappear'. I was voicing my frustration to my sister the entire way home; No chase? No fighting? No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed! But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree. I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway? Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie. Jason Schwartzman was perfect."

h19	=	"Incredibly disappointing, and here's why: Too much content and story forced into the movie, making it rushed and, at times, quite messy. Hardly any likable characters; didn't get to know any of them particularly well and certainly didn't sympathize with them. Too much singing. Some props, costumes, and elements threw me off, making me forget this was part of the Hunger Games universe. It felt more like a drama romance from the present time, especially in the second half of the movie. Some characters seemed oddly 2023-like, despite being set hundreds of years into the future. Rachel Zegler, in particular, just \"looks\" Gen Z. Viola Davis, the queen, in a cheap costume and with an even cheaper manuscript. The other Hunger Games movies were like an emotional rollercoaster, whereas this movie left me uninterested and little invested. I was really not looking forward to feeling \"nothing\"."
h20	=	"This fifth film in the Hunger Games cinematic universe is insightfully written by Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt, based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins, and efficiently directed by Francis Lawrence. Tom Blyth excels in his role as young Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler's luminous presence radiates through the screen as Lucy Gray Baird. There's a natural goodness built into us all. No. Really. We can either cross that line into evil, or not. And it's our last work to stay on the right side of that line. - Lucy I am going to get you out of here. But if I'm going to risk everything, tell me, is this real? - Coriolanus Their love story is as intense as it is brief and as hopeful as it is revealing of what human beings become when civilization disappears."

h21 = "I was a bit mislead when i thought The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is gonna be about the early days look of the game, but instead it's actually about Snow and how his 'innocence' ends. Although I enjoy how brutal and violence this film is, it lacks of thrill, little to no action, and have a weird amount of singing scene.... and for what reason?Blyth did a good job portraying Snow and his characters is well written, while Zegler's character lacks of charm and borderline cringe. But i guess kudos to her for trying. The third act pace dropped dramatically, while feel rushed at the same time with some unclear plot point and abrupt end.7/10.Lackluster, but i still enjoyed it."

h22 = "I came out of the cinema with my friend and we both wondered what we had actually just seen.Is this a villain origin story?Because if so, then why is there NO character arc for Snow at all?From the moment you meet Coriolanus Snow (despite the lacking story still wonderfully played by Tom Blyth), he is selfish, overly ambitious and mean. For this reason, I don't buy into his romance with Lucy for a minute, and I actually think they didn't want you to. But if the romance isn't real, that means there is no catalyst for Snow's character to make him evil, because as I said, he was already selfish, manipulative and mean to begin with. It makes you wonder why we needed this film in the first place.Next to this, I didn't understand Lucy's character. She wears colorful clothes, lots of make-up and sings musical songs which all feels off for someone living in district 12.On top of this, I also didn't understand her motives and emotions. Is she angry she has to fight for her life in the hunger games? She didn't really seem to be to me, as she quickly trusts Snow and eats his food and even tries to kiss him. And then when she wins the fight you would expect her to be traumatized and bitter, but no, she just picks up her guitar again and dances around in her not-so-Gray clothes.Finally, as the romance isn't real, why did she invite Snow to escape with her to the North and then on the way there tries to get rid of him?! It just didn't make sense to me AT ALL.Still gave this three stars because I liked Tom Blyth's performance and the visuals were nice, I guess."

h23 = "While this is not a bad effort it lacks the actors of the original trilogy.Here there are no donald sutherland no jennifer lawrence.The actors who substituted them are not of the same value.Especially the new lead female can not be compared with lawrence.The actor who plays a younger version of donald sutherland a.k.a snow is an ok actor but he is no sutherland.Add the absence of a convincing storyline and motive and what u get is another try to cash in to a brand name franchise the hunger games is.What happens at the end between snow and lucy is not explained and the reasons why she is just vanished. Anyhow u can check this out but i'm afraid the magic the first films had are now gone with the wind. Grade // C."

h24 = "This movies felt rushed and confusing with some very interesting changes from the book. It didn't feel like there was any development of key relationships and the overall feel of the main characters was off. Performances were fine, no problems there (just a questionable accent). The biggest change from the book that really ruined it for me was the order and method of deaths in the hunger games. The book seemed to create some parallels between the two main characters but the change to the hunger games deaths took that away. The biggest change from the book that really ruined it for me was the order and method of deaths in the hunger games.

Don't watch this movie expecting it to be a good representation of the book like the other hunger games movies were."

h25 = "Wow! I'm so impressed by everything about this movie, the acting, the camera work and of course amazing costume and makeup. It's a perfect adaption from the film, doesn't really leave out any characters or important details. Some characters are gone from the book but you don't think about it at all and nothing is missing.In the beginning I admit it's a little quick with everything that's happening but I think that's a choice and I agree with it for most part. A really great detail is also that it is divided in parts and that's really cool according to me.All actors are amazingly cast and they do a really good job. The one person that totally steals the show is of course Viola Davis, terrifying and amazing in every scene.Tom is stunning as a leading man and he really embodies Snow in all that he is.I want to recommend this movie to everybody and I can't explain my love for it."
